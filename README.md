# fnpassbyvalue.cpp
This program demonstrates pass by value in C++. The function dosomething() takes a copy of num, modifies it, and prints intermediate results. However, the original variable in main() remains unchanged, showing that changes inside the function do not affect the callerâ€™s variable.
